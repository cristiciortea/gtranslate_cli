# gtranslate_cli
Google Translate is a fabulous tool, but we are hardcore hackers and resent the browser. As such, weâ€™d like to use the command line for doing string translation. At the same time, we are polyglots and know multiple languages (RO, IT, EN, DE). What we want is a CLI tool that can translate between Romanian, Italian, German and English. The tool will read input data from a file and output the translation to the console. The output language is specified as a flag on the command line.

### Notes:
- use this program in linuxOS or macOS
- you need to have a GCP service account that has access to the Google TranslationAPI
(for instructions to generate Gooogle Translate API credentials, please follow the short tutorial [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-translation-python3#0)

### Setup:
Step 1:
Type
`git clone https://github.com/cristiciortea/gtranslate_cli.git`
in the shell  

Step 2:
Add path to credential .json file to the environment (.env file) or just export it:

GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path_to_your_service_account_key_json_file>  
**or**  
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=[PATH]
