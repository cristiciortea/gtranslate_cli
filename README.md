# gtranslate_cli
Google Translate is a fabulous tool, but we are hardcore hackers and resent the browser. As such, weâ€™d like to use the command line for doing string translation. At the same time, we are polyglots and know multiple languages (RO, IT, EN, DE). What we want is a CLI tool that can translate between Romanian, Italian, German and English. The tool will read input data from a file and output the translation to the console. The output language is specified as a flag on the command line.
